**INFO:**

Tool uses the static links for the Enterprise EVAL ISOs to download as source.

Then downloads the SVF to create the en-us Consumer or Business ISO from it.

When source was created properly it will download the SVF for the chosen language
and create the ISO.


In case the Source EVAL/Consumer/Business ISOs (mentioned beneath) are present, the download is skipped, just copy them
to tools folder.
